# Privacy Feature Implementation

## Overview
The Migrant Donor App now includes a comprehensive privacy feature that ensures donor contact information is only revealed after a request is accepted. This creates a safe environment for both donors and beneficiaries.

## How It Works

### 1. Request Process
- **Anonymous users**: Can browse donations but cannot request items (redirected to login)
- **Authenticated users**: Can request items, but donor contact info remains hidden
- **Privacy maintained**: Phone numbers and addresses are not visible until acceptance

### 2. Acceptance Flow
1. **Request made**: User requests an item ‚Üí donor gets notification
2. **Donor reviews**: Donor sees request details (name, email only)
3. **Donor accepts**: Donor clicks "Accept" button
4. **Contact revealed**: Requester can now see donor's phone and address
5. **Both notified**: Both parties receive in-app and push notifications

### 3. Privacy Levels

#### Before Acceptance:
- ‚úÖ Donor name
- ‚úÖ Donor email  
- ‚ùå Donor phone number
- ‚ùå Donor address
- üîí Privacy notice: "Contact information will be revealed after accepting this request"

#### After Acceptance:
- ‚úÖ Donor name
- ‚úÖ Donor email
- ‚úÖ Donor phone number  
- ‚úÖ Donor address
- üéâ Acceptance notice: "Your request has been accepted! You can now contact the donor"

## Notification System

}
```
